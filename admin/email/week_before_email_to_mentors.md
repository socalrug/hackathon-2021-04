Hello:

Thank you for agreeing to mentor the hackathon participants. 

We will be using Zoom breakout rooms during the event. You will be placed in a room and you can help the participants. When you feel that they no longer need your assistance or you want to move to another group, just come back to the main room and we can move you into another breakout room.

During the events, the participants will generally need help understanding how to approach the data, what questions to ask and how to build and interpret models. Whatever guidance you can give them will be greatly appreciated.

Since this is a virtual event we will be using slack and Zoom. You will probably have to set a few things up.
1. Please download [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) and [Slack](https://slack.com/) prior to the event.
1. If you are not on the [OCRUG Slack channel](https://socalrug.slack.com/) please [sign-up](https://socalrug.herokuapp.com/).
