# OCRUG Hackathon: April 10 - 11, 2021

## Event Summary

The OCRUG Hackathon, hosted by the [Orange County R Users Group](https://ocrug.org) and the [UCI Paul Merage School of Business](https://merage.uci.edu) is a two day event where we will "hack" a data set for fun, education, and prizes.  The focus of the event is on education and teamwork, with the main goal of taking a data set from its "raw" form all the way through to a final "product" (e.g. visualization, insight, presentation).  At the end of the event, teams will present their work in short presentations.  Fellow attendees will help judge the work with prizes awarded in several categories (more below).

The event will start with a series of practical educational tutorials to get you started with fundamental data analysis using the R programming language, followed by working sessions where teams will explore and analyze a data set in preparation for the team presentations. Participants will work in small teams, ~ 5 people each.

This event is open to data scientists, enthusiasts and hackers of all levels, from the beginner to the highly experienced.  If you are a beginner, it may be helpful to do some preparatory learning before the event — see the suggested resources below.  If you are an experienced user, we look forward to you sharing your expertise with others. Assisting others, even across teams, is highly encouraged.

## Goals of the Hackathon

* The hackathon is primarily an *educational* event, not a competition.  We hope that the event will allow participants to practice their skills, as well as teach and learn from others.
* *Novice Users*: provide an opportunity to work with a real-world data sets from start (acquire the data) to finish (produce a final presentation on the findings from their work).
* *Experienced Users*: provide an opportunity to practice data analysis skills in a structured environment, interact with others, and assist new users.
